Here are the main entry points to learn more about ejabberd
configuration. ejabberd is extremely powerful and can be configured in
many ways with many options.

Do not let this complexity scare you. Most of you will be fine with
default config file (or light changes).

Sections:

- [File Format](file-format/)
- [Basic Configuration](basic/): hosts, acl, logging...
- [Authentication](authentication/): auth_method
- [Database and LDAP](database-ldap/)
- [Listen Modules](listen/): c2s, s2s, http, sip, stun, xmlrpc...
- [Listen Options](listen-options/)
- [Top-Level Options](toplevel/)
- [Modules Options](modules/)

There's also a copy of the old [Configuration](old/) document which was used up to ejabberd 20.03.
