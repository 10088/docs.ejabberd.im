# Integrate push notifications to your applications

Boxcar is a push service that allows developers to integrate push notifications to their applications. It can be integrated in developer's applications through the use of a [SDK](/sdk/), available for [Android](/sdk/android), [Kindle Fire](/sdk/amazon), [Nokia X](/sdk/nokia) and [iOS](/sdk/ios).

Push notifications are typically sent to mobile users when some events occurs on the developer servers / back-end. An HTTPS [publisher API](/api/publisher) is available to allow developer to send notification to either a single device, a single user or a group of users.
