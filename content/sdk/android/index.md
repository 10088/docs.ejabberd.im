# Android SDK Documentation

We recommend using the SDK <%= @item[:version] %> version, which supports the new GCM client from Google Play Library, and includes several enhancements that simplify the interaction with the framework.

Read [Android SDK <%= @item[:version] %> documentation](2.0/). 

If you have already built your application based on the former SDK version and don't want to perform changes to your code, then you can keep using it.
