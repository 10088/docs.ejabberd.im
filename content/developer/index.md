# ejabberd for developers

As a developer, you can customize ejabberd to design almost every type
of XMPP related type of solutions.

As a starting point, we recommend that you get extremely familiar with
both the core XMPP protocol itself and its extensions.

From that, once you understand well XMPP, you can tame ejabberd to
build your dream messaging system.
