# ejabberd for developers

As a developer, you can customize ejabberd to design almost every type
of XMPP related type of solutions.

As a starting point, we recommend that you get extremely familiar with
both the core XMPP protocol itself and its extensions.

From that, once you understand well XMPP, you can tame ejabberd to
build your dream messaging system.

# Getting started

The first step is to install / configure your development environment:

* [Installing ejabberd development environment on OSX](install-osx/)
* [Use Ansible to auto provision a development environment in a VM](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd-vagrant-dev)

# Customizing ejabberd

* [Development guide](guide/) (Currently being updated)
* [ejabberd modules development](modules/)
