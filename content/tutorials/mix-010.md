# Getting Started with MIX v0.1.0

MIX stands for Mediated Information eXchange and is defined in draft
of [XEP-0369](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0369.html#disco-service).

It is a work in progress extension for the XMPP protocol to build a
group messaging protocol that does not rely on the presence
mechanism. It is designed to overcome the limitation of XEP-0045
Multi-User Chat, in a context where most clients are mobile clients.

To do so, MIX is built on top of PubSub
([XEP-0060](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0060.html)) and use
different nodes per channel to separate event types. There is five
nodes to support five different types of event for each MIX
conversation:

* Messages
* Presence
* Participant list changes
* Subject update
* Conversion configuration changes

This is a work in progress, but this is a very important task and we
are happy to provide the very first server implementation of the Mix
protocol to get up to speed on that specification.

Here is a short walk through what can already be done.

Please, note that this is a work in progress and that the
specification can (and will) change significantly before it becomes
stable. This blog post is based on XEP-0369 v0.1.

## Configuration

Configuration is simple:

* You need to build
  [ejabberd from source](https://github.com/processone/ejabberd),
  latest master version.
* You need to add mod_mix in ejabberd configuration, modules section:

  ~~~ yaml
  modules:
  ...
    mod_mix: {}
  ~~~

* Make sure you have pubsub enabled. Default configuration is fine:

  ~~~ yaml
  modules:
  ...
    mod_pubsub: 
      access_createnode: pubsub_createnode
      ignore_pep_from_offline: true
      last_item_cache: false
      plugins: 
        - "flat"
        - "hometree"
        - "pep"
  ~~~

## Usage

There is no client supporting MIX yet so here is how it works directly
at XMPP stream level.

Here are real-life examples from playing with our MIX implementation:

### Joining a MIX conversation

You can join a MIX conversation if you know its jid (id@mixservice):

You can send a join IQ:

~~~ xml
<iq type='set'
    to='hellomix@mix.localhost'
    id='E6E10350-76CF-40C6-B91B-1EA08C332FC7'>
  <join xmlns='urn:xmpp:mix:0'>
    <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages'></subscribe>
    <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence'></subscribe>
    <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants'></subscribe>
    <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject'></subscribe>
    <subscribe node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:config'></subscribe>
  </join>
</iq>
~~~

You receive IQ that confirms success:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost"
    type="result" to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="E6E10350-76CF-40C6-B91B-1EA08C332FC7">
 <join xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:0" jid="admin@localhost">
  <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages"></subscribe>
  <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence"></subscribe>
  <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants"></subscribe>
  <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:subject"></subscribe>
  <subscribe node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:config"></subscribe>
 </join>
</iq>
~~~

Subscribers on the participants node for that channel will also
receive the new list of participants (so, including ourselves in that
case):

~~~ xml
<message from="hellomix@mix.localhost"
         type="headline"
         to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael">
 <event xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants">
   <item id="3d1766e2bd1b02167104f350f84b0668f850ef92">
    <participant xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:0" jid="admin@localhost"></participant>
   </item>
  </items>
 </event>
</message>
~~~

Note: Nickname registration support is not yet implemented in our
code.

### Sending and receiving messages

You can now start chatting with your peers, by publishing on the
message node:

~~~ xml
<iq type='set'
    to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'
    id='mix2'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <publish node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages'>
      <item>
        <body xmlns='jabber:client'>Hi, there !</body>
      </item>
    </publish>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

Server confirms publishing:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost"
    type="result"
    to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="mix2">
 <pubsub xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub">
  <publish node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages">
   <item id="5B1AB7F432DA5"></item>
  </publish>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

Message is received by all subscribers on the message node on that MIX conversation:

~~~ xml
<message from="hellomix@mix.localhost"
         type="headline"
         to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael">
 <event xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages">
   <item id="5B1AB7F432DA5">
    <body xmlns="jabber:client">Hi, there !</body>
   </item>
  </items>
 </event>
</message>
~~~

### Sending and receiving presence

The presence in MIX conversation is conceptually independent from
presence stanzas in standard XMPP protocol. In MIX, the presence is
simply a state you want to broadcast to the subscribers of the
presence node in the conversation.

The presence is broadcast through the Mix conversion, in a similar way to message:

~~~ xml
<iq type='set'
    to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'
    id='mix3'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <publish node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence'>
      <item>
        <presence xmlns='jabber:client'>
          <c xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/caps'
             hash='sha-1'
             node='http://code.google.com/p/exodus'
             ver='QgayPKawpkPSDYmwT/WM94uAlu0='></c>
        </presence>
      </item>
    </publish>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

As you can see, presence is model on XMPP presence specification. In
that case, we included caps info for example in our broadcast.

Server confirms presence broadcast to sender:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost"
    type="result"
    to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="mix3">
 <pubsub xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub">
  <publish node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence">
   <item id="5B1ACB064CE"></item>
  </publish>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

And finally, participants to conversation subscribe to presence will receive presence update:

~~~ xml
<message from="hellomix@mix.localhost"
         type="headline"
         to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael">
 <event xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence">
   <item id="5B1ACB064CE">
    <presence xmlns="jabber:client">
     <c xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/caps"
        node="http://code.google.com/p/exodus"
        ver="QgayPKawpkPSDYmwT/WM94uAlu0="
        hash="sha-1"></c>
    </presence>
   </item>
  </items>
 </event>
</message>
~~~

The presence at the moment is somewhat in between in current state of
the XEP. To retract the presence you send a standard XMPP presence of
type unavailable:

~~~ xml
<presence type='unavailable'
          to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'/>
~~~

Server confirms retracting the presence item:

~~~ xml
<message from="hellomix@mix.localhost"
         type="headline"
         to="test@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael">
 <event xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#event">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence">
   <retract id="5B1ACB064CE"></retract>
  </items>
 </event>
</message>
~~~

This part is still unfortunate as it still makes it difficult to
manage presence on mobiles were the status, that is the ability to
receive messages, is somewhat disconnected from the session
state. This is likely an area that will change significantly in the
future.

Another thing to note is that for the moment, all your presence
publications are kept as items, but going offline retract them all.

### Querying participants list

A participant can always get list of participants with a Pubsub query
on node items for the conversation:

~~~ xml
<iq type='get'
    to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'
    id='mix4'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants'></items>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

The conversation will reply with list of participants:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost"
    type="result"
    to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="mix4">
 <pubsub xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:participants">
   <item id="1a3b7690ea2608d13988aca8339acf759daa8483">
    <participant xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:0" jid="test@localhost"></participant>
   </item>
   <item id="3d1766e2bd1b02167104f350f84b0668f850ef92">
    <participant xmlns="urn:xmpp:mix:0" jid="admin@localhost"></participant>
   </item>
  </items>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

### Querying the presence

You can query the presence as well:

~~~ xml
<iq type='get'
    to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'
    id='mix5'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence'></items>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

and you get a list of "available" users:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost"
    type="result"
    to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael"
    id="mix5">
 <pubsub xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:presence">
   <item id="5B1ADB972CEC">
    <presence xmlns="jabber:client">
     <c xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/caps"
        node="http://code.google.com/p/exodus"
        ver="QgayPKawpkPSDYmwT/WM94uAlu0="
        hash="sha-1"></c>
    </presence>
   </item>
  </items>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

### Getting the list of messages

With a similar pubsub query, you can retrieve the list of messages:

~~~ xml
<iq type='get'
    to='HelloMix@mix.localhost'
    id='mix5'>
  <pubsub xmlns='http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub'>
    <items node='urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages'></items>
  </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

Server replies with list of messages:

~~~ xml
<iq from="HelloMix@mix.localhost" type="result" to="admin@localhost/MacBook-Pro-de-Mickael" id="mix5">
 <pubsub xmlns="http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub">
  <items node="urn:xmpp:mix:nodes:messages">
   <item id="5B1ABD0BD973D">
    <body xmlns="jabber:client">Hi, there is is test !</body>
   </item>
   <item id="5B1AB7F432DA5">
    <body xmlns="jabber:client">Hi, there !</body>
   </item>
  </items>
 </pubsub>
</iq>
~~~

As you can see there, there is need for improvement to rely on this
list for history of messages. First, you do not have message
attribution (see Caveats section), but this can be worked out.  Also,
you do not have timestamp on the messages.

This part will likely change a lot in the future. I expect that a link
with
[Message Archive Management](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0313.html)
support will be a more efficient and more consistent way to deal with
message history.

## Caveats

At the moment it is unclear from XEP-0369 example how you match a
message you receive to a participant. We are going to improve our
implementation in the following way:

1. Add a participant id on the item tag when broadcasting new participant.
2. Add the participant id on the published items.
3. Add the participant id in participants list on the publisher

Another issue is that the current specification and implementation
will have trouble scaling and offer plenty of opportunities for
"Denial of Service" attacks. This is something that will change in the
future as the specification matures. However, currently, do not deploy
or rely on this implementation for large-scale production
services. The work is still an experiment to progress on the
specifications by offering client developers to give real life
feedback on a reference implementation of the current specification.

## Conclusion

We are only at the beginning of MIX. However, we are excited to have
reached a point where it is already usable in some cases.

It is still missing on administrative tasks, right management, user
invitations, relationship with MAM archiving and probably a lot
more. And we need consolidations on participants message
attribution. However, we want to iterate fast with client developers
to prototype implementation changes and have meaningful and real life
feedback to improve XEP-0359.
